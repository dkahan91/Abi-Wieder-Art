    <p>Hi I'm Abi. I love creating beautiful, passionate and meaningful pieces of art. I could say I have always loved what I do and am a prolific painter, but that would not quite be the truth  - in fact I spent close to eight years barely producing a thing! People would often say to me,' it must be such fun to paint, so nice and relaxing!'.. umm well actually, during that time, painting was about the last thing in the world I would do to relax. Painting brought with it feelings of stress (what should I paint??? Help , stare at blank canvas) Feelings of judgement ( this piece is so bad I can't bear to look at it) And high expectations ( this is just not good enough obviously this painting business is not for me) . Enough to make anyone's creative flow freeze! So I how did I get here, on a website with plenty of nice artwork? 
Well it's a long story but in short I have started to chill out ( in my mind at least!😂) and connect more to my inner self beneath the expectations judgements and stress. I have started to rediscover the magic of letting the creative juices  flow and the enjoyment of the art process with it's ups downs and all arounds!! I love working with inks, pastels, watercolors and oil paints drawing subjects that are close to my heart- the land of Israel, people and all things green. 

Abi wieder lives in Jerusalem with her husband and four kids.
